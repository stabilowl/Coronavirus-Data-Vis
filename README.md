# Coronavirus-Data-Vis

This repository contains R code and datasets that were used for the visualisation of the 2019-nCov Epidemic in Jan 2020. 

The goal of this project is to visualise the data related to the number of cases and number of deaths due to the 2019-nCov Epidemic, both in China and around the world. Apart from personal interests to this epidemic due to my family ties in China, it also serves as an exercise for data visualisation using R. The main tool that was used in this project is ggplot2. 

The visualisations are also included in this repository, including graphs and animations that was created from the graphs generated. 

A review of the results can be found in my blog post on this project, https://stabilowl.data.blog/2020/02/13/coronavirus-crisis-2020-a-data-perspective/ 

The code and details for a online dashboard can be found in the dashboard folder. The dashboard can be found at https://stabilowl.shinyapps.io/COVID-19-dashboard/
